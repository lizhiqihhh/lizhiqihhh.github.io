We propose a novel normal filtering neural network, which the first subnetwork is responsible for denoising and the second subnetwork refines normals for better feature preservation. Our NormalF-Net bridges the connection between CNNs and geometry domain knowledge of nonlocal Similarity. Meanwhile, other learning-based geometric processing tasks may benefit from our well-formatted NPNMs.
